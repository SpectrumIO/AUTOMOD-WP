# AUTOMOD-WP

This repository contains Spectrum's WordPress plugin. Pull requests and issues are welcomed.

**This is beta software!** While we're making every effort to fix issues quickly, we can't
guarantee that this plugin is 100% functional just yet.

## Building the Project

To build the project from source, you'll need SASS installed. Running `gem install sass` 
should to the trick. Then, simply run `make install` to compile the source files. Compiled
files will appear in a `target` directory at the root of the project, which can then be uploaded
to your WordPress installation for testing.
